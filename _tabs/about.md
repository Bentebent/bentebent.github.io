## About this blog

This blog is mostly about:

- Trying to learn new things and failing forward
- Appreciating the human element of software engineering
- Maybe some cool looking 3D graphics and games

If you enjoy seeing the perspective of someone learning new things this might be the place for you. I mostly post about things I explore and new learnings I encounter in my day-to-day as a software engineer.

## About me

Hello, I'm Tim and I currently do 3D things at IKEA. I'm a software engineer that loves anything software but especially game development and 3D graphics. I live in southern Sweden where I have been doing various kinds of software development since 2015. I always aspire [to thinking like the self-aware smol brained](https://grugbrain.dev/) and this blog is in many ways me exploring how to get better at that.
